## Walkthrough:
Yahoo Finance API helps to query for all information about finance summary, stocks, quotes, movers, etc. I have used its free version where the free tier of Yahoo Finance API gives 500 calls/month.  It provides user with a lot of various API;s for various type of requirements. I have taken into consideration its "getSummary" APU and designed a test webpage to display all the data from various regions in a table using Django frameworl.
For reference, you can take this link into consideration. (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yahoo-finance1)

## Features:
 * Basic Django Framework used to display data.
* For API calls, both django framework and JS versions are taken into considerations
